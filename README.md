# Kubernetes cluster bootstrapping template

This is mirrored to GitHub, the code can be found at: https://git.ncsa.illinois.edu/kubernetes/radiant-cluster-template

This repo contains a template to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster hosted on an OpenStack platform. It is specifically designed for use with OpenStack-based cloud computing platforms Radiant (NCSA) and Jetstream2 (Indiana University); however, it should be flexible enough to target any OpenStack instance.

## Initialize your project Git repo from the template

Your cluster's private repo needs to be hosted on a service that supports Terraform state version control such as GitLab. The `$CLUSTER_GIT_REPO` environment variable below will typically be of the form

```bash
CLUSTER_GIT_REPO="git@gitlab.com:${CLUSTER_PROJECT}/${CLUSTER_NAME}.git"
```

Thus if you name your cluster `cuddlefish` and your research project is `marine-biology`, and you host your repo on `gitlab.com`, then your Git repo could be `git@gitlab.com:marine-biology/cuddlefish.git`.

To get started, clone this repository, rename the remote, and attach to a new origin. This will allow you to pull in the latest template changes, and push them to your own private repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ncsa/radiant-cluster-template.git $CLUSTER_NAME
cd $CLUSTER_NAME
git remote rename origin template
git remote set-url --push template no_push
git remote add origin $CLUSTER_GIT_REPO
git push -u origin --all
git push -u origin --tags
```

To update from template repository

```bash
git fetch template
git merge template/main
git push
```

## Customize cluster configuration files

In the `terraform` folder are the scripts that you can use to start a new cluster using Terraform. First, you need to customize and prepare some files:

- `terraform.tfvars` : Customize to override default values for supported parameters as needed. Do not include secrets in this file; it should be save to commit.

- Copy `cluster.example.json` to `cluster.json` and customize to define your cluster nodes.


## Obtain OpenStack application credentials and Rancher token

Open the OpenStack Horizon web interface and navigate to **Identity -> Application Credentials** and create a new one for use by Terraform. Set the Terraform variables as shown below in `terraform/secrets.auto.tfvars`. (All `*.auto.tfvars` files are included in `.gitignore` to avoid uploading secrets to your remote repo.)

```
openstack_credential_id     = "f5****28"
openstack_credential_secret = "b2**************Vw"
```

From the Rancher web interface, navigate to **Account and API Keys** and create an API key, copying the value into the same secrets file like so:

```
rancher_token                 = "token-wmrk9:nb************c2"
```

## Update Terraform modules (optional)

If you have previously initialized the Terraform state and want to update the Terraform modules, you must delete them prior to executing `terraform init` as described below:

```bash
cd terraform
rm -rf .terraform/modules/{argocd,openstack_cluster,rancher_cluster}
```

## Initialize the Terraform state

To download the Terraform modules and initialize the Terraform state you have two options: (1) Operate completely locally or (2) configure a backend to push state updates to a remote location. Configuring a remote backend is recommended when collaborating with others, because it provides shared access and a mechanism for state locking to prevent accidental conflicting updates.

(Note that if you have already initialized a Terraform repo, subsequent initialization commands need the `terraform init -reconfigure` option.)

### Local state only

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

### Use a remote backend (optional)

Create a file called `backend.tf` with the content below See [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.html) and [Terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/http) for more info.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
  }
}
```

Next you need to initialize and configure the backend. Generate a new GitLab project access token via the GitLab web UI and assign to `PROJECT_PASSWORD`. The token must be granted role `Maintainer` with scopes `api`, `read_repository` and `write_repository` to allow Terraform state storage. The `PROJECT_ID` can be found in the Settings > General page of the target repo in GitLab.


```bash
PROJECT_BASE_URL="https://git.ncsa.illinois.edu" \
PROJECT_ID=123 \
CLUSTER_NAME="kubernetes" \
PROJECT_USERNAME="access_token_name" \
PROJECT_PASSWORD="access_token_value" ; \
terraform init \
  -backend-config="address=${PROJECT_BASE_URL}/api/v4/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/terraform/state/${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
  -backend-config="lock_address=${PROJECT_BASE_URL}/api/v4/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/terraform/state/${CLUSTER_NAME}/lock" \
  -backend-config="unlock_address=${PROJECT_BASE_URL}/api/v4/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/terraform/state/${CLUSTER_NAME}/lock" \
  -backend-config="username=${PROJECT_USERNAME}" \
  -backend-config="password=${PROJECT_PASSWORD}" \
  -backend-config="lock_method=POST" \
  -backend-config="unlock_method=DELETE" \
  -backend-config="retry_wait_min=5"
```

## Run Terraform plan and apply

âš  If you have used the OpenStack CLI in your shell session, ensure that the associated environment variables are unset or you will see errors when executing `terraform plan`.

```bash
unset $(set | grep -o "^OS_[A-Za-z0-9_]*")
```


## ArgoCD Applications

The folder `charts` can contain Helm charts that are referenced from the root app. An convenience app is placed there called `kubernetes`. This application will deploy all files in the `kubernetes` folder by default. To enable this process set `kubernetes.enabled` to true in `values.yaml`. You can add more applications to this Helm chart, as well as the specific values to the `values.yaml` file to setup your cluster. If this git repo requires authentication you can configure a [git repo](examples/gitrepo.yaml) in the ArgoCD folder (see below).

## GitLab Pipelines

You can setup a GitLab runner to automatically apply any changes you make to the git repo and update the cluster, for example to add/remove worker nodes. You can leverage of the ability to store variables at the project and group level. For example you can have a group where you keep all your clusters and use this for shared secrets, and have per project secrets for each git repo.  The variables will need to be called `TF_VAR_<variable-name>`. 

Copy the [example](examples/gitlab-ci.yml) of the GitLab runner to `.gitlab-ci.yml`

### ArgoCD

You can create a folder called `argocd` and place the files to be applied to the ArgoCD cluster. The pipeline will check during the `deploy` stage to see if the folder exists, and if it does, it applies the files to the ArgoCD cluster. This is a convenient way to get [git repo](examples/gitrepo.yaml) defined (using sealed secrets off course) as well as the [root app](examples/apps.yaml) for the cluster.
